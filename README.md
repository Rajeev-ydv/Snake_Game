# SnakeGame

The game concept has been taken from old snake game that we played in earlier mobile phones.
Completely implemented in JavaScript, HTML and CSS.


It has been poorly implemented, but working to make it more better.


How to play:
 1. Download mygame.html and mygamejs.js and keep them in same folder.
 2. Open mygame.html in any browser and it's start!

For Developers:
Any Chages or ideas are highly appreciated and are invited to contribute to make it more functional and real.
